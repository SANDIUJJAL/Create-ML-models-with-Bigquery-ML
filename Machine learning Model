Create ML Models with BigQuery ML: Challenge Lab
Overview
In a challenge lab you’re given a scenario and a set of tasks. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you will use the skills learned from the labs in the course to figure out how to complete the tasks on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

When you take a challenge lab, you will not be taught new Google Cloud concepts. You are expected to extend your learned skills, like changing default values and reading and researching error messages to fix your own mistakes.

To score 100% you must successfully complete all tasks within the time period!

This lab is recommended for students who have enrolled in the Create ML Models with BigQuery ML skill badge. Are you ready for the challenge?

Setup
Before you click the Start Lab button
Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click Start Lab, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
Note: Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.
Time to complete the lab—remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
Note: Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.
Challenge scenario
You have started a new role as a junior member of the Data Science department. Your team is working on multiple projects with a number of machine learning initiatives. You are expected to help with the development and assessment of data sets and machine learning models to help provide insights based on real work data sets.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks, so don't expect step-by-step guides to be provided.

The following tasks in this lab check your knowledge related to BigQuery and machine learning.

Task 1. Create a new dataset and machine learning model

The following tasks in this lab check your knowledge related to BigQuery and machine learning.

Task 1. Create a new dataset and machine learning model
One of the projects you are working on needs to provide analysis based on real-world data. Your role in this project is to develop and evaluate machine learning models.

So, in this task, you have to create a dataset with the dataset ID ecommerce in which you can store your machine learning models.

Now create the machine learning model customer_classification_model to predict the performance of the model. Run the following query to create the customer_classification_model.
